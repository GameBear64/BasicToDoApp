This is a toy app meant to demonstrate my ability to create full-stack solutions.

# *Will add more features soon!*

## Setup
I have provided a script to setup the packages and run the backend migrations:
```sh
npm run setup
```
After that is done you can run the application:
```sh
npm run dev
```
Go to [localhost](http://localhost:5173/) to see the results.
